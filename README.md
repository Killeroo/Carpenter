# Carpenter - Static Website Generator

Carpenter is a homebrew Static Site Generator ([SSG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator)), initially developed for [my photography website](https://matthewcarney.info/photos/feb-2021/). 

Initially created so that I could easily create and curate pages for my photography site it's functionality has grown along with my requirements. It contains a suite of tools: A commandline tool for managing all aspects of a site, benchmarks and desktop applications for designing and previewing the layout of each page of a site in realtime. All this is supported by a fairly solid core framework for HTML generation and wider site configuration.

The tool is designed to read a template file, which is then used to generate subsequent pages based on a `SCHEMA` file. The resulting page is a combination of the information contained in the schema and the template html file.

# Usage

There are a few different ways that Carpenter can be used:

- `SiteViewer` - This is a winforms application which gives you an overview of the entire site. It always you to kick off site wide builds, validations and publishing (out)

# Website layout

Carpenter expects the contents of the local

using the local directory layout as a map for what the website paths will look like

The basic layout of a 
```
├── dir2
│   ├── ...
│   └── SCHEMA
├── Photos
│   ├── Bishkek
│   │    ├── ...
│   │    └── SCHEMA
│   └── London
│        ├── ...
│        └── SCHEMA
├── template.html
└── SITE
```

# Glossary

Carpenter uses quite a few terms to describe different aspects of the site is wants to generate. So this list should help you decipher what is going on:

### Core Terms

| Term | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `SITE` | The main configuration file of a website. It is stored at the local root directory of the website.|
| `SCHEMA` | A schema file represents a page in the website. Their directory, relative to the `SITE` file and local site root, matter as this determines the path the schema uses in the generated website. For example, a `SCHEMA`|
| `template.html` | This is the html file that Carpenter uses to generate html pages. It contains `Tokens` and `Tags` which specify content that should be replaced or inserted into the template depending on what type of page is being generated.|
| `Token` | This is a placeholder string which is found in the template html file. These `Tokens` are replaced with values specified in `SCHEMA` files. |
| `Tag` | Tags are similar to tokens but allow sections of HTML to be dynamically added to the outputted HTML as required by the contents of a `SCHEMA` file. They are specified in the `SITE` file. |
| `Option` | Options are fields in `SITE` and `SCHEMA` file that, while not directly included in generated html, determine how the page or site is generated and what is generated. |
| `Generated HTML` | HTML which has been generated by Carpenter using the contents of `SITE` and `SCHEMA` files. |

### `SCHEMA` Terms

These are terms used specifically in the `SCHEMA` file:

| Term | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Section` | Term used to describe the headers used inside a `SCHEMA` file. Surrounded by square brackets in the actual `SCHEMA` file (EG, `[TAGS]`) they represent different parts of configuration for a given `SCHEMA`. |
| `Layout Section` | The layout section is a part of the `SCHEMA` file which specifies how the page should be laid out. There are multiple different `Sections` (`IMAGE_COLUMN`) which can be contained in the `Layout Section`. |

### Operations

There are a few different types of operations that Carpenter can perform when it comes to making a website. While many of them will sound like truisms, it is still important to not what they mean in the context of Carpenter.

| Term | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Building` | This is the act of building (or generating) HTML for a given website based of data stored in `SITE` and `SCHEMA` files.|
| `Previewing` | Previewing is a little like building except for the outputted html is viewable locally, useful for previewing changes locally before uploaded. |
| `Publishing` | This is an all encompassing step which involves building the final website html (read to be uploaded), validating .|
| `Validating` | Carpenter has a few different tests it runs to make sure that `SITE` and `SCHEMA` files are correctly formatted. These validation tests are can be optional or required, if a required validation fails (EG a required property in a `SCHEMA` file is missing) then Carpenter will not generate a site.

# Motivation

I wanted to host my photos as simple static html files. And initially wrote a small tools to generate said files instead of having to constantly tinker with the code of each page manually. From there it grew as my website did along with it's requirements.

The framework as a whole should be observed as a sort [outsider art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outsider_art) for modern web development. I created it and the concepts most of from scratch and with little understanding of how other SSGs worked.

In the end this framework was a way of doing 2 things; Making my website and making the act of making websites interesting to me.

It's not as general as other tools, it's quite a highly tailored tool so it will never be as useful to others as other more entrenched web development practices will be. But in a way that is the reason I wrote it.
